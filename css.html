        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used to control the presentation and layout of web pages, allowing developers to separate content from design. Introduced in 1996, CSS enables the application of styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements, thereby enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of websites. By defining styles in external stylesheets, CSS promotes cleaner and more maintainable code, as well as consistency across multiple pages of a website. The language supports a range of styling features, including responsive design techniques through media queries, advanced layout systems like Flexbox and Grid, and animations for dynamic visual effects. CSS also enables customization through variables and pre-processors like Sass and Less, which streamline complex styling tasks. Its powerful capabilities and widespread support across web browsers make CSS an essential tool for creating modern, visually engaging web experiences.</p>
