        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental building block of the web, serving as the standard markup language used to create and structure content on web pages. Developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML provides the framework for organizing and displaying text, images, links, and other multimedia elements within a web document. Using a system of tags and attributes, HTML allows developers to define the structure and semantics of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms. As the backbone of web development, HTML works in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and functionality of web pages. HTML's straightforward syntax and its role in creating the foundational elements of web content make it an essential skill for anyone involved in web design and development.</p>
