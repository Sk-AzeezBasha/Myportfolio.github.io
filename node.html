        <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and networking applications using JavaScript. Released in 2009, Node.js revolutionized web development by enabling JavaScript to run outside the browser, making it possible to use a single programming language for both client-side and server-side development. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is known for its high performance and scalability, handling a large number of simultaneous connections with high throughput. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it particularly efficient for I/O-intensive tasks such as real-time applications, API servers, and streaming services. The npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem, the largest software registry, provides a vast array of libraries and modules that can be easily integrated into Node.js projects, further accelerating development. With its strong community support and extensive documentation, Node.js has become a popular choice for developers seeking to create fast, scalable, and efficient network applications.</p>
