        <p>Spring Boot is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of Java-based applications by providing a pre-configured, opinionated setup. Part of the larger Spring Framework ecosystem, Spring Boot aims to reduce the complexity of developing and deploying production-ready applications by eliminating much of the boilerplate code and configuration. It achieves this through convention over configuration, offering a range of defaults and auto-configuration options that allow developers to get up and running quickly. Spring Boot integrates seamlessly with various Spring modules, such as Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring MVC, to build comprehensive applications with minimal effort. Additionally, it includes embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty, which streamline the deployment process by enabling applications to run independently without needing an external server setup. With its strong focus on microservices architecture, robust tools for monitoring and managing applications, and extensive documentation and community support, Spring Boot has become a popular choice for developers looking to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance Java applications.</p>
